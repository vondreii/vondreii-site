            <br>
            <p>
              There are some things I wish I knew when I first started uni, which would have definitely helped me settle in a lot faster than I did.
              I started uni not being very familiar with how the environment would be, how I'd fit in, or what you needed to focus on to make the most out of the experience.
              Some of these I didn't realise I needed to do until my final year - so hopefully this will help some of you aspiring uni students out there. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="subheading"><strong>1. Take Your Studies And Deadlines Seriously</strong></p>
            <p>
              This is quite obvious, but it is easier said than done. It is very easy to fall into the trap of procrastinating and underestimating the amount of time you need to do something.
              If you are investing time and money into study something, it is safe to assume that you may have future plans for it. 
              I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBiRs15JxfE&list=TLPQMDgwNjIwMjBIQmf5o79S4w&index=1">this</a> powerful video of a student who is studying to become a surgeon.
            </p>
            <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              He slacks off, doesn't study and therefore resorts to paying his lecturers and the board to give him his license and certification. However when faced with real world scenarios, he realises he does not know how to operate on a patient
              resulting in her death, and is faced with the realisation that he only cheated himself.
              This might seem a bit extreme as most people will not be able to relate to bribing.
              However the underlying concept is that more often than not, some students realise they don't have enough time left for an assignment, so they put half the effort in just to get that solid 'Pass'
              while failing to understanding the bigger picture of some of the important concepts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align:center">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              Always focus on the end goal. 
              If you find somewhere down the line that you just do not feel motivated because you are not interested, then it is possible the field may not be the one for you.
              Most students study full time or part time. Which means they need to spend the appropriate number of hours that match this expectation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="subheading"><strong>2. Prepare Your Study Notes </strong></p>
            <p>
              How are you going to write your notes down? Through writing in notebooks or using a computer? If you choose to use notebooks, buy them before the semester starts.
              Colour coding courses can also help. However, don't overdo it or you may overwhelm yourself further down the track if you see you have too many colourful things to do.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are using a computer, make sure you don't have files scattered all over the place. Ideally you should organise each module or course into their own folder.
              For instance, if you studied 4 courses/subjects, you would have 4 folders. Each folder can have sub folders related to the content learnt in that course.
            </p>

            <p class="subheading"><strong>3. Joins Clubs And Do Volunteering</strong></p>
            <p>
              There should be flyers or posters around campus that can direct you on how to join certain groups. 
              This might be a bit nerve-racking, especially as a first year student. Uni does have it's share of bad apples but it is a far cry from the 'survival zone' that is high school.
              Uni has so many different people, it is very possible to meet friends that have similar interests to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Volunteering is also a great way to enhance communications skills which can help you for when you apply for your next job.
              You don't even have to take difficult volunteering shifts. 
              When I volunteered at the uni, shifts included greeting people for events (and putting tags around their wrists),
              gardening, or helping other students with disabilities. I spent a good year or so being a walking guide assistant for another student who was blind, and even though it had nothing to do with my actual software degree,
              it exposed me to other interesting life skills and experiences like having a carer's responsibility.
            </p>

            <p class="subheading"><strong>4. Don't Buy Text Books From The Uni Shop</strong></p>
            <p>
              Absolutely DO NOT. This is the Golden Rule if you do not believe in wasting money. The shops are (in my honest opinion) a complete rip off.
              Do not spent $100 on a text book that is the exact same as the previous editions except for a page or two.
              Try and find a secondhand book or another way to source it online. You can probably find the exact same book on one of the many online ecommerce sites like eBay or Amazon. 
              You can even try locally and look at the Facebook Marketplace. The price difference is usually massive. Sometimes you can pay $15-30 or more on something that costs $120 at the uni's bookshop.
            </p>
            <p>
              And while we are on the topic of textbooks, an equally more important tip is to NOT sell your textbooks to the uni's bookstore when you are finished. 
              I once sold a book I wasn't using anymore and got a measly $5 for it. The same book I had previously bought for around $60.
              I started using the Facebook Marketplace to sell old textbooks and started getting a much better secondhand price for other students
              who were willing to buy them.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="subheading"><strong>5. Grades Are Not Everything - Focus On The Content And Learn From Your Mistakes</strong></p>
            <p>
              Ask many people who have graduated. Chances are 9/10 will say that no one (or minimal people) have asked them about their grades.
              What matters more is experience. You are much more likely to be chosen for something if you have experience.
              Take web development as an example. Student A has focused very hard to get a High Distinction in every course. Student B
              has good grades but they are not as good as student A. However, Student B has also invested his own time in doing one or two side projects related to building and hosting websites
              as a hobby. Student B has something that student A doesn't - something real that works and shows what they have learnt
              in practice. This doesn't mean Student A will struggle to find a job - it just means that Student B likely stands out more.

            <p class="subheading"><strong>6. Change Your Expectations</strong></p>
            <p>
              Uni is temporary, and the worst case scenario would be to leave uni going, "What have I actually learnt this whole time?" 
              Cue the <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/43528/im-graduating-with-a-computer-science-degree-but-i-dont-feel-like-i-know-how-t/43652">posts</a> all over the internet.  
              Uni doesn't teach you everything. A lot of degrees (not all - some degrees can be very streamlined to industry work) teaches you the bare minimum for you to start off with. You acquire the remaining knowledge as you grow in the industry, or by doing self study or side projects.
              It is better to go into uni knowing this so you can enter with the right mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take Computer Science for example. Depending on the uni, some courses are quite outdated. 
              When I took a web development course, we spent time learning XSLT (which is pretty much dead as of 2020). We never went into how to host websites, 
              what Search Engine Optimisation was, or how to use modern frameworks (like Angular or React, which are used in the REAL world). 
              However, we did learn the basic concepts of HTML/CSS and JavaScript, how they work together and how routing worked.
              So when I started learning about other frameworks in my own time, they were just an addition to the basic concepts I had learnt from uni. 
            </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              My point is not to expect uni to do all the work for you. Uni gives you the basic concepts and it is up to you to enhance them either through work experience in future years (like when you are in second, third or fourth year) 
              or by taking your own initiative.
