        This is a collection of Python automation scripts to help me with the data analysis for my research project on

      <h5>Background</h5>
      <div class="pb-3"></div>
      <p>
        Each participant was required to play two versions of a game. For each version, they needed to play the game three
        times. In total, one participant had 6 excel files. In total there were 40 participants. 40*6 = 240 excel files. This is
        a very time consuming process so <a class="cyanLink" href="https://www.sorakhan.com/">my partner</a> suggested to
        automate this process.

      <h5>Data Analysis Script</h5>
      <div class="pb-3"></div>
      <p>
        This script does simple analysis and maths calculations on the data. 
        <a class="cyanLink" href="https://www.sorakhan.com/">My partner</a> initially created the script which is stored in 
        <a class="cyanLink" href="https://github.com/sorakhan/data-analysis-script"> this Github repository</a>. 
        Since then, this script has been modified to include new summary tables and maths calculations. It calculates things such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finding the average reaction times at specific times in the game</li>
        <li>Calculating the total crashes within a specific timeframe during the gameplay (eg, between 10-20 seconds)</li>
        <li>Calculating the Standard Deviation and Averages of the player's response times, and DRT misses</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="pb-3"></div>

      <h5>Clean Data</h5>
      <div class="pb-3"></div>
      <p>I created this to delete some columns in the excel files that were unecessary.</p>
      <div class="pb-3"></div>
      
      <h5>The Template</h5>
      <div class="pb-3"></div>
      <p>
        The template was created so it was easier to create more automated scripts in the future. The template asks the user for
        a folder that stores excel files, and loops through each excel file in the folder, and prints any details.
