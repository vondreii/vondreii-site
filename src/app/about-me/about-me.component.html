        <ul>
          <li>I love experimenting with different designs, and learning about making websites.</li>
          <li>I develop games and simple applications that solve problems (Java or C#).</li>
          <li>I take photos as a hobby and edit them in lightroom or VSCO.</li>
          <li>Anytime I have a break, I always take the opportunity to travel somewhere new.</li>

      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        I like learning about new things and try to fill some of my spare time with small projects outside my work hours (and by watching lots of documentaries).
        I've been self-learning and exploring some concepts like Hugo, Angular and Firebase.
      </p>
      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I have done quite a few projects at uni related to creating games with Unity and C#. Some were course related and others were research related.</li>
        <li>I also worked with Node.js and Firebase for a small research project.</li>
        <li>I also do software testing and QA automation at my current job.</li>
        <li>I have played with a couple of languages (Java, C#, some Python, some C++) - I made a simple automation script in Java to help speed up some of the formal processes in my last job, and I would be keen to pick them up again with the mindset that I am willing to learn and build more experience.</li>
      </ul>
