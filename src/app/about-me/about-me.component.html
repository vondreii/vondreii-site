  <!-- Intro -->
  <p>
    I like learning about new things and I try to fill some of my spare time with small projects outside my work hours. Currently I've been self-learning and exploring some concepts like Hugo, Angular and Firebase.

  <ul>
    <li>I currenty work full time in Software Development.</li>
    <li>I used to work full time in QA, and this included both QA automation tasks and manual testing.</li>
    <li>I have done quite a few projects at uni related to creating games with Unity and C#.</li>
    <li>My main side project that I am working on uses Firebase, Node.js, and Angular.</li>
    <li>This website uses Angular, but it has gone through iterations of other tech stacks in the past (hugo, vanilla js, html, css).</li>
    <li>I really like the idea of automation. I made a simple automation script in Java to help speed up some of the formal processes at my last job.</li>
