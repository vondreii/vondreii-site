  <!-- Intro -->
  <p>
    I like learning about new things and I try to fill some of my spare time with small projects outside my work hours (and watching lots of documentaries).
    I've been self-learning and exploring some concepts like Hugo, Angular and Firebase.

  <!-- Experience -->
  <h4>Experience</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>I have done quite a few projects at uni related to creating games with Unity and C#. Some were course related and others were research related.</li>
    <li>I also worked with Node.js and Firebase for a small project.</li>
    <li>I also do software testing and QA automation at my current job.</li>
    <li>I have played with a couple of languages (Java, C#, some Python, some C++). I made a simple automation script in Java to help speed up some of the formal processes in my last job, and I would be keen to pick them up again with the mindset that I am willing to learn and build more experience.</li>
