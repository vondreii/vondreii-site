# Building A Second Brain using Notion: Storing Everything You Know In One Place
<hr>

I always try to learn new things but sometimes I feel like a lot of the information doesn't stick. For example, one of my favourite things to do is to watch documentaries. I would watch about 1-3 a week, and they would be on all kinds of different topics: aircrafts, animals, true crime, disasters and more. At some point I realised that there were some I remembered, others I had completely forgotten, and others which I only remembered partially. So even though I had been learning a lot of new information, I had never really 'retained' it.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

This was pretty much the same for a lot of other aspects in my life. Things I had learned from articles or books, advice people had given me, or even events in my life that I wanted to remember.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I was trying to use my brain to store and remember EVERYTHING in my life. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

After 20-30 years, it is very easy to start forgetting the details. You'd be forgetting things daily. It was even hypothesised that in the first 24 hours, your brain could forget about 40% of any new information it recieves.

That's when my <a class="cyanLink" href="https://sorakhan.com">husband</a> introduced me to the concept of the **Second Brain** through <a class="cyanLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8">this video</a>.

### **Having A Second Brain**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

A Second Brain is simply just a single place where you store the things you know and learn. Whatever you store depends entirely on you and is based on what things add value to your life.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Before, I was mostly relying on my brain to remember everything I knew or any new information I had learnt. If I did need to write things down, I would store information in many different places (like my notes app on my phone, notepad files on my computer, or my daily planner, just to name a few). However, the process of remembering where to find something takes mental load. The idea of having a single place where you know you can go to takes a lot of the mental load away. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

There are lots of platforms you can use. <a class="cyanLink" href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is one for example. I am using <a class="cyanLink" href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a>. It doesn't matter what you use. It could be as simple as having very well organised note taking files. However, it is the way you use it, and the way you present the information which is important. You want to make it as easy as possible to find the information you want (almost like a mini database!)

### **How I Use Notion**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I have split up my Notion account into separate 'main' pages, each focusing on a separate aspect of my life. I have categorised these into:

<div class="pb-3"></div>

- Self Development (shared with Hubby)
- Household (shared with Hubby)
- Life
- Planning
- Health
- Finances
- Work
- Side Projects
- Education

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Self Development**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

At first I started using Notion to record the things I had learnt that I didn't want to forget. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Since documentary-watching was a very close hobby of mine, I thought I'd backtrack some of the past documentaries I watched. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

	<div class="image-description"><p>List of Docos</p></div>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

It took me a very long time to backtrack and re-compile the list. At the time of writing, I ended up with 93 (but most of those were only from the last 2 years alone). What was interesting was that I had completely forgotten about some of these, but when I was actively backtracking, I immediately started remembering them again. It was amazing to me how much information I had learned, only to forget shortly after.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Now, when I look at this list, I am able to see a clear and complete picture of the things I have learnt over the years and this brings value into my life. It definitely makes a massive difference being able to visualise what I've been doing all these years. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I share this with the hubby since he likes reading my summaries :) 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

In the **Self Development** tab I also have a list of articles and books I have read, and what I have learnt from them. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Now, whenever I read or watch something new, I just add it to the list.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Household**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

This is something that I share with Hubby. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

We usually try to be open and always communicate about what we can do to help each other, so anything we share goes into this page.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

For example:

<div class="pb-3"></div>

 - **Recipes:** We sometimes forget the exact measurements of ingredients, so instead of re-finding links to Tasty articles, we just collate everything in here.
 - **Shopping:** This is like our inventory of items. We list here the weekly essentials we need to get. We also do meal planning so we will buy ingredients based on what we plan to cook that week. 
 - **Cleaning:** This includes things in the house that need to be cleaned, and we take turns or allocate who does what.
 - **Wedding:** This is an example of an event that we plan together.
 - **Dual finances:** We list any financial goals we have together as a couple, and we keep track of them together.
 - **Shared Projects:** Anything that we both work on together, we will add it in here.

</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Life Goals, Events, etc**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Another thing I like to keep track of is my life in general. I never use to do this. But doing it now helps me with my overall mindset in general.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I'm not that into journaling, though I do see the benefits of it. What works better for me though is to just store the major events that happened throughout my life. This ranges from parties, holidays, good times at uni/work, family time, self development milestones, to darker moments from earlier years. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

When I write things I am grateful for, I also include it in here.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Planning**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I also have a **Planning** tab where I write down notes for any upcoming events. For example, during Christmas, I will use it to keep track of the gifts I need to get people.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Health**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Under the 'Health' tab, I list my usual exercises I do during my weekly home routines. All I have to do is grab my laptop, IPad or phone, open to this page, and follow my routine.  

<div class="pb-3"></div>

	<div class="image-description"><p>Fitness</p></div>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Finances**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Here I track all my accounts. I include yearly financial goals so I keep ontop of my savings. I have notes and lists of how much I want to allocate to my savings account, how much I want to invest, or how much I put away to pay back any debt.   

<div class="pb-3"></div>

	<div class="image-description"><p>Finances</p></div>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I include notes about my target portfolio and any goals regarding how much I would like invested in which stocks/ETFs by the end of the year. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Work**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Under the 'Work' tab, I include a copy of my resume. I also have a reflection about what I learnt at each workplace, and what I liked and didn't like, so I can continuously keep learning about myself. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

One of the main things I use it for is to keep track of my job applications whenever I actively apply. Instead of sending thousands of resumes left and right, I try to focus on a few places that I feel I would be a good fit for based on the job description, work culture (and sometimes, reviews), and keep track of my progress with them.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Side Projects**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Here I put a list of my side projects. In each of these pages I include to-dos, deadlines, notes or ideas. That way I can keep track of my progress for each project I am working on. This ties in with the **Work** tab a little bit, because some of these can be listed as experience on the resume :)

<div class="pb-3"></div>

</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Education**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

My last (but not least important) tab includes anything regarding formal education. I have a list of any degree/s or courses taken, with some brief notes and summaries about what was learnt in each of them (just so I have an overview of it all as a whole). This is also where I add in formal online courses or bootcamps that I participate in.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

For example, I am currently trying to improve my Angular skills and learn it the 'formal' way, so I have been studying a course outside normal working hours and writing any notes I have about it in here.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

### **Conclusion**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Notion is just an example of any tool you could use to store what you know and to better organise aspects of your life in a central place. These are just a few examples of how I have been using it, and I hope it has been helpful for you. Thank you for reading! :)
