# Upload An Image To Instagram Using A Desktop Computer
<hr>

Sometimes you need to upload photos to Instagram on a computer, especially if you are using a computer to edit photos or create vector art. It can be really annoying to keep transferring them onto your phone and uploading it from there (and if you can't airdrop it using an IPhone, the quality of these photos can be reduced).

First, open a web browser and navigate to your Instagram account. We will be using Google Chrome as an example. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Right click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect Element**:

<div class="pb-3"></div>

<!-- ----------- Image ----------- -->
<div class="image-container">
	<img src="./assets/blog/images/uploadImageToInstagramViaDesktop/1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="image" class="image-75"/>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

In the top bar there is an option to view the screen on a different device. You can select any phone device - for this post we have selected the Samsung Galaxy S5.

<div class="pb-3"></div>

<!-- ----------- Image ----------- -->
<div class="image-container">
	<img src="./assets/blog/images/uploadImageToInstagramViaDesktop/2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="image" class="image-75"/>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

The screen size should now change to the shape of a phone (but the upload button will not be visible).

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Now go to the top of your web browser bar and hit the refresh button to refresh the webpage. 
When the page reloads, the Instagram bar should now be visible:

<div class="pb-3"></div>

<!-- ----------- Image ----------- -->
<div class="image-container">
	<img src="./assets/blog/images/uploadImageToInstagramViaDesktop/3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="image-75" class="image-50"/>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

<div class="pb-3"></div>

If you click on the upload icon (the plus symbol in the very center of the menu bar) you should be able to start the uploading process as if you were using your phone.

Now you should finally be able to upload photos to your Instagram account on your computer!
