I always try to learn new things but sometimes I feel like a lot of the information doesn't stick. For example, one of my favourite things to do is to watch documentaries. I would watch about 1-3 a week, and they would be on all kinds of different topics: aircrafts, animals, true crime, disasters and more. At some point I realised that there were some I remembered, others I had completely forgotten, and others which I only remembered partially. So even though I had been learning a lot of new information, I had never really 'retained' it.

This was pretty much the same for a lot of other aspects in my life. Things I had learned from articles or books, advice people had given me, or even events in my life that I wanted to remember.

I was trying to use my brain to store and remember EVERYTHING in my life. 

After 20-30 years, it is very easy to start forgetting the details. You'd be forgetting things daily. It was even hypothesised that in the first 24 hours, your brain could forget about 40% of any new information it recieves.

That's when my [husband](https://sorakhan.com) introduced me to the concept of the **Second Brain** through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8).

### Having A Second Brain

A Second Brain is simply just a single place where you store the things you know and learn. Whatever you store depends entirely on you and is based on what things add value to your life.

Before, I was mostly relying on my brain. If I did need to write things down, I would store information in many different places (like my notes app on my phone, notepad files on my computer, or my daily planner, just to name a few). However, the processes of remembering where to find something takes mental load. The idea of having a single place where you know you can go to takes a lot of the mental load away. 

There are lots of platforms you can use. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) is one for example. I am using [Notion](https://www.notion.so). It doesn't matter what you use. It could be as simple as having very well organised note taking files. However it is the way you use it, and the way you present the information which is important. You want to make it as easy as possible to find the information you want (almost like a mini database!)

### How I Use Notion

I have split up my Notion account into separate 'main' pages, each focusing on a separate aspect of my life. I have categorised these into:
- Self Development (shared with Hubby)
- Household (shared with Hubby)
- Life
- Planning
- Health
- Finances
- Work
- Side Projects
- Education

#### Self Development

At first I started using Notion to record the things I had learnt that I didn't want to forget. 

Since documentary-watching was a very close hobby of mine, I thought I'd backtrack some of the past documentaries I watched.

	<div class="image-description"><p>List of Docos</p></div>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

It took me a very long time to backtrack and re-compile the list. At the time of writing, I ended up with 93 (but most of those were only from the last 2 years alone). What was interesting was that I had completely forgotten about some of these, but when I was actively backtracking, I immediately started remembering them again. It was amazing to me how much information I had learned, only to forget shortly after.

Now, when I look at this list, I am able to see a clear and complete picture of the things I have learnt over the years and this brings value into my life. It definitely makes a massive difference being able to visualise what you've been doing all these years. 

I share this with the hubby since he likes reading my summaries :) 

In the **Self Development** tab I also have a list of articles and books I have read, and what I have learnt from them.

	<div class="image-description"><p>List of Reading Material</p></div>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

Now, whenever I read or watch something new, I just add it to the list.

#### Household

Write something

#### Life Goals, Events, etc

Another thing I like to keep track of is my life in general. I never use to do this. But doing it now helps me with my overall mindset in general.

	<div class="image-description"><p>Life Events</p></div>
</div>
<!-- ----------------------------- -->

I'm not that into journaling, though I do see the benefits of it. What works better for me though is to just store the major events that happened throughout my life. This ranges from parties, holidays, good times at uni/work, family time, self development milestones, to darker moments from earlier years. 

#### Planning

I also have a **Planning** tab where I write down notes for any upcoming events. For example, during Christmas, I will use it to keep track of the gifts I need to get people.

### Conclusion

Notion is just an example of any tool you could use to store what you know. These are just a few examples of how I have been using it, and I hope it has been helpful for you. Thank you for reading! :)
