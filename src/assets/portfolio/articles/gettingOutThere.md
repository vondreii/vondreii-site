## **About**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

This is a podcast I started with my partner <a class="cyanLink" href="https://www.sorakhan.com/">Sora Khan</a> in 2021, where we talk about experiences in work, life, and as students. It's about learning, growing and becoming better versions of ourselves. We try to share useful tips to students if  there are things we learnt that might benefit others.

The podcast website is a Hugo site. We chose Hugo because it was fast to implement, and we didn't have to focus so much on the layout and design of the website. We wanted to focus more on the content. Our hugo site is hosted on Netlify, using Github.
