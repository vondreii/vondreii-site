## **Background**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I am a massive documentary fan and have compiled a list of hundreds of documentaries I have personally watched throughout the years. Some of these documentaries are not very well known and a Google Search doesn't bring up much information. 

<div class="pb-3"></div>

I have compiled my own list of documentaries in one place where I tag them based on their categories and store links to where I have watched them. This was all for hobby purposes. I wanted to learn more about <a class="cyanLink" href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> so I decided to make this into a mini ongoing pet project.

At the moment this is only a proof-of-concept and the real designs have not been implemented.

## **Tech Stack**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

* Angular Typescript (including ngx-markdown library)
* Markdown
* Firebase Cloud Firestore
* NodeJS
* Future plans include using APIs to get existing documentaries from established websites but for now the focus is on lesser known documentaries that float around the internet.

## **What I Learnt or Improved**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

* How to link an Angular website to a Firebase Database 
* Utilising services and Firebase queries to access and retrieve data
* Creating a basic search bar that can search for documentaries based on title, decription, category or keyword
* Database Design
