### About

Docosummaries is a place where you can:
* Learn about new documentaries
* Read blurbs and plot summaries of documentaries
* Find links where you could watch the documentaries online

### Background/Context

I am a massive documentary fan and have compiled a list of hundreds of documentaries I have personally watched throughout the years. Some of these documentaries are not very well known and a Google Search doesn't bring up much information. I have also categorised these documentaries using a convenient tagging system and have recorded links and more information about them. Along with this info I also write summaries about each of them. I was doing this long before thinking of DocoSummaries and it was just for 'hobby' purposes.

I decided to start making this website as a 'niche' area for people who are interested in documentaries. 

### Tech Stack

The website uses:
* Angular Typescript (including ngx-markdown library)
* Markdown
* Firebase Cloud Firestore
* NodeJS
* Future plans include using APIs to get existing documentaries from established websites but for now the focus is on lesser known documentaries that float around the internet.
