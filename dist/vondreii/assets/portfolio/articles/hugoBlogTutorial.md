## **Background**

<div class="pb-3"></div>

Hugo is one of the many ways you could create a website. Hugo is a Static Site Generator that has themes/layouts that have already been created by developers. These themes can be used to create websites quickly and without having to worry too much about the code or logic. Hugo uses Markdown files for the content. This means that all you need to do is write your content in Markdown for each page.

A Hugo website can be created locally on someone's computer. They can push the code to a remote Github repository. Netlify is a hosting platform that can host a website that is stored on Github, so that anyone can access the website on the Internet.
