Decluttering helps us organise the things around us and can also help improve our overall wellbeing. Everyone can benefit from decluttering, and it's interesting to see how many things are lying around that we can reconsider keeping. Here is a list of some items that you could declutter right now.


### Room 1: Living Room

The living room is usually the first thing people see when they walk into your house, and the room where a lot of us spend most of our time in while we are at home. So understandably, there might be a lot of stuff lying around that we probably don't even know exists. 
When was the last time you opened that drawer full of CDs? Probably not in a while.

1. **Old/damaged cables** that are no longer used.
2. **Trinkets** that are on display. Of course, don't remove the ones ones that have sentimental meaning.
3. **Books** that are never read.
4. **DVDs** or **CDs** that are never played (we have Netflix now!).
5. **Devices** that are no longer used, such as old DVD players. If you have kids that moved out (and they left their game consoles) you can give it to them.
6. **Magazines, loose papers or receipts.**
7. **Small furniture** (if you have too many sidetables/stools around).
8. If you have too many **photo frames**, you could reduce the amount that are on display.
9. **Small things** sitting on/around the coffee table (such as coasters or mugs).
10. **Plants** on display.</li>
11. **Light sources**. 1 or 2 lampshades depending on the living room size should be enough.

### Room 2: Dining Room

The Dining Area doesn't need too many things. If you have cabinets surrounding the dining table, now is the perfect time to have a look at what is there. Any old table cloths or towels could be considered for decluttering. Again, don't get rid of anything that has sentimental value.</p>
