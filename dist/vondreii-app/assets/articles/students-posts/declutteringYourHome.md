Decluttering helps us organise the things around us and can also help improve our overall wellbeing. Having a home or workspace that is well organised can improve productivity and make you feel more in control overall. Here is a list of some items that could be decluttered right now. These are just examples, so you do not have to remove any items that are of sentimental value.


### Room 1: Living Room

1. **Old/damaged cables** that are no longer used.
2. **Trinkets** that are on display. Of course, don't remove the ones ones that have sentimental meaning.
3. **Books** that are never read.
4. **DVDs** or **CDs** that are never played (we have Netflix now!).
5. **Devices** that are no longer used, such as old DVD players. If you have kids that moved out (and they left their game consoles) you can give it to them.
6. **Magazines, loose papers or receipts.**
7. **Small furniture** (if you have too many sidetables/stools around).
8. If you have too many **photo frames**, you could reduce the amount that are on display.
9. **Small things** sitting on/around the coffee table (such as coasters or mugs).
10. **Plants** on display.
11. **Light sources**. 1 or 2 lampshades depending on the living room size should be enough.

### Conclusion

As you can see, there are so many possible things you could consider decluttering in your home. It can be very difficult to do this in one go, so doing it in sections can help.
It is useful to have three piles: **'definitely keeping'**, **'maybe'** and **'definitely do not need.'**<br><br>
**Definitely Keeping:** Keep! <br>
**Maybe:** Keep them in a bag and go through them in a few weeks and decide again. <br>
**Definitely Do Not Need:** These items can be put in bags and given to charity organisations (like the Salvation Army), sold for extra cash, or put on the side of the road for council collection.
