Fish - Fish can be collected in order to score points throughout the game. These points add up to a total score at the end.


Scrolls - There is a single scroll on every level. Each scroll has a question about climate change which must be answered correctly in order to get an extra 200 points.

Diamonds - Similar to fish, these are collected in order to score points throughout the game. These are found more frequently and are therefore worth less points.


Chocolate bar - There is a single chocolate bar on every level. These are worth more points than fish and diamonds. There are usually puzzles that need to be solved in order to reach the chocolate bar.
